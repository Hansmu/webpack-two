Single page app
A bare-bones HTML file gets sent to the user. Javascript then runs on the user machine to create a full webpage.
We rely on a bunch of Javascript code.

In a SPA we have a ton of Javascript code. In server side rendering/templating there isn't nearly as much JS code.

When you split up your JS codebase into several files(modules), it increases its readability. This, however, has downsides.
Problems that arise:
1) Load order. Some files rely on other files. If it gets loaded in the wrong order, then it all collapses. Load order should be the same every time.
2) More files, slower load times. Downloading dozens of Javascript files cause performance issues. Especially on mobile devices.

Webpack handles these problems by taking all of our JS files and merge them into one large JS file, while making sure execution order is correct for the files.
This is Webpack's primary purpose.

Javascript has several module systems. To name some:
CommonJS (used in NodeJS): Uses 'require', 'module.exports'
AMD (used in frontend): Uses 'require', 'define'
ES2015: Uses 'import', 'export'

Webpack automatically searches for webpack.config.js file.
Specifying entry point for Webpack tells it what to execute first when our application starts up in the browser.
Have to use double quotes in scripts. Should run the local copy inside node_modules. Helps to handle juggling versions between projects.
